			<h1>1. What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h1>
			<small>
				An access token is a short-lived credential issued to a client after successful authentication. It grants the client authorization to access
				specific resources or perform actions on behalf of the authenticated user. Access tokens are included in each request to the server to
				authenticate and authorize the client&apos;s access to protected resources. On the other hand, a refresh token is a long-lived credential also
				issued during authentication. Its purpose is to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires. Refresh tokens are securely
				stored on the client-side and used to request a new access token from the authentication server. The typical flow involves the client
				authenticating with the server, receiving an access token and a refresh token, using the access token to access protected resources, and using
				the refresh token to obtain a new access token when needed. Access tokens are typically stored in memory on the client-side, while refresh
				tokens need to be stored securely in mechanisms like HTTP-only cookies or client-side storage with appropriate security measures. Proper
				storage and protection of access tokens and refresh tokens are crucial to prevent unauthorized access to user data. Following security best
				practices is essential to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access or exposure of these tokens.

			<h1>2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h1>
			<small>
				SQL databases are well-suited for structured data with complex relationships and strict data integrity requirements. They are suitable for
				applications that rely on transactional operations and complex queries. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are designed for handling
				large-scale, dynamic, and rapidly evolving data. They provide high scalability, flexible data models, and better performance in scenarios
				where the data structure is less defined or subject to frequent changes. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific
				requirements and characteristics of the application and data being managed.

			<h1>3. What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h1>
			<small>
				{" "}
				Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It focuses on simplicity and provides essential functionality
				for building web applications and APIs. It is widely adopted, has a large community, and offers a vast ecosystem of middleware and plugins.
				NestJS, on the other hand, is a full-featured web application framework for Node.js that follows the architectural patterns of Angular. It is
				built with TypeScript and embraces modern design principles. NestJS provides a module-based architecture, a powerful CLI, and supports a wide
				range of features out of the box. It integrates well with databases, messaging systems, and third-party libraries. The choice between
				Express.js and NestJS depends on your project requirements and development preferences. Express.js is ideal for developers who prefer a
				minimalistic and flexible approach, while NestJS suits those who prefer an opinionated framework with built-in support for scalable and
				maintainable application development.

			<h1>4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h1>
			<small>
				In summary, MongoDB&apos;s aggregate is a framework that enables advanced data processing and analysis within the MongoDB database. It
				operates through a pipeline of stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on input documents and passes the results to the next
				stage. The aggregation framework provides various stages such as match, group, project, sort, limit, skip, unwind, and lookup, among others.
				These stages allow for filtering, grouping, transforming, and aggregating data in flexible ways. With the aggregate framework, you can perform
				complex operations on collections of documents directly within the database, reducing the need for client-side processing. The aggregate
				framework is powerful for generating reports, performing analytics, and aggregating data across documents or collections. It offers a
				versatile toolset for manipulating data and extracting meaningful insights from MongoDB databases.
